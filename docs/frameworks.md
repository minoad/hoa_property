# Frameworks

## 1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Framework

ETL is a common framework used in data processing that involves three main steps:

- **Extract**: Collecting data from various sources (PDF, Word, images, etc.).
- **Transform**: Processing the data to convert it into a suitable format (OCR for images, extracting text from documents).
- **Load**: Storing the processed data in a database (MongoDB).

## 2. Pipeline Framework

A pipeline approach ensures that each stage of the process is well-defined and smoothly transitions into the next stage. The stages include:

- **Input Handling**: Identifying and accepting the input files.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracting images and text from the files.
- **OCR Processing**: Converting images to text.
- **Data Storage**: Storing extracted text in MongoDB.
- **Preparation for Analysis**: Ensuring the text is ready for textual analysis.

## 3. Six Sigma DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) Framework

This framework focuses on improving processes by breaking them down into five stages:

- **Define**: Clearly define the problem and objectives.
- **Measure**: Collect data and establish baseline metrics.
- **Analyze**: Identify issues and potential improvements in the extraction and OCR processes.
- **Improve**: Implement solutions to improve extraction accuracy and efficiency.
- **Control**: Maintain the improvements and ensure consistent performance.

## Explanation of Each Framework

### ETL Framework

- **Extract**: Use libraries like PyPDF2 for PDFs, python-docx for Word documents, and PIL or opencv for images.
- **Transform**: Use OCR tools like Tesseract to convert images to text, and extract text using appropriate file parsers.
- **Load**: Use MongoDBâ€™s Python driver (pymongo) to store the extracted text.

### Pipeline Framework

- **Input Handling**: Implement file handling logic to accept various file types.
- **Data Extraction**: Parse documents and extract images.
- **OCR Processing**: Apply OCR to the extracted images.
- **Data Storage**: Store the results in MongoDB.
- **Preparation for Analysis**: Clean and format text for analysis.

### DMAIC Framework

- **Define**: Define the scope and requirements of the project.
- **Measure**: Benchmark the initial performance of text extraction and OCR accuracy.
- **Analyze**: Identify bottlenecks or inaccuracies in the extraction process.
- **Improve**: Optimize extraction and OCR techniques.
- **Control**: Develop monitoring processes to ensure ongoing quality.
